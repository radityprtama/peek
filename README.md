# Peek

Run your dev server. Share it instantly.

Peek starts a project's development server, finds its local port, and creates a
temporary public HTTPS URL with a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel. It is built for
remote machines, SSH sessions, mobile terminals, and cloud development
environments where opening `localhost` is inconvenient.

## Install

Node.js 22 or newer is required. Peek itself runs on Node.js; a project may use
pnpm, npm, Yarn, or Bun.

```sh
pnpm add -g @radityprtama/peek
```

`npm install -g @radityprtama/peek` also works. Peek downloads a pinned,
checksum-verified `cloudflared` binary on first use and reuses it afterward.
You do not need to install `cloudflared` yourself.

## Quick start

```sh
cd my-project
peek
```

The project needs a `dev` script in its `package.json`. Peek runs the detected
package manager's `dev` command, waits for a reachable server, then connects
the tunnel. Press Ctrl+C to stop both processes.

```text
Peek

✓ pnpm project
· Preparing tunnel engine...
· Starting pnpm dev...
· Waiting for server...
✓ Server ready on :3000
· Connecting tunnel...
✓ Tunnel connected

Local   http://localhost:3000
Public  https://example-words.trycloudflare.com

Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

The public URL changes each run. Peek uses Cloudflare's Quick Tunnel service;
it does not operate a relay or require a Peek account.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `peek` | Detect and run the current project's `dev` script. |
| `peek dev` | Alias for `peek`. |
| `peek --port 5173` | Use the specified server port after checking it was free before startup. |
| `peek --qr` | Show a terminal QR code when the terminal can display it. |
| `peek --no-qr` | Suppress the QR code. |
| `peek --provider cloudflare` | Select the only v0.1 provider. |
| `peek --verbose` | Show Cloudflare diagnostics and error details. |
| `peek -- npm start` | Run an explicit executable and arguments instead of a `dev` script. |
| `peek --help` / `peek --version` | Show help or version. |

Flags go before `--`; tokens after it are passed as an executable and arguments
without a shell. See [CLI details](https://github.com/radityprtama/peek/blob/main/docs/CLI.md) for precedence and examples.

Peek supports pnpm, npm, Yarn, and Bun projects. Its managed tunnel binary
supports Linux x64/ARM64, macOS x64/ARM64, and Windows x64. Linux and macOS
are the primary v0.1 reliability targets. Silent servers on unusual ports may
need `--port`.

## Security

**A Peek public URL exposes the selected local service to anyone who has the
URL for as long as the tunnel is running.** Peek does not add authentication;
an unpredictable URL is not a password. Do not run Peek against a server that
contains secrets, private data, or unsafe development endpoints unless that
server protects them itself. Peek sends web traffic through Cloudflare, but
does not upload source code or collect telemetry. Read the [security
guide](https://github.com/radityprtama/peek/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md) before sharing sensitive previews.

Cloudflare says Quick Tunnels are for testing and development, with no uptime
guarantee. They currently do not support Server-Sent Events and limit
concurrent proxied requests. See [Cloudflare's Quick Tunnel
documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/).

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

See [development](https://github.com/radityprtama/peek/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)
for local linking and release checks, and
[troubleshooting](https://github.com/radityprtama/peek/blob/main/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
if startup fails.

## Roadmap and license

v0.1 focuses on automatic server discovery, one temporary Cloudflare tunnel,
QR output, and reliable cleanup. Additional providers and configuration are
ideas for later releases, not commitments. See the
[roadmap](https://github.com/radityprtama/peek/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md).

Peek is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/radityprtama/peek/blob/main/LICENSE). The downloaded
`cloudflared` binary is a separate Cloudflare component with its own
[license and terms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/#legal).
